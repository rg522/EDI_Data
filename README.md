# EDI Data
Datasets and Draft Analyses at the Intersection of Analytics and EDI Issues

### Table of Contents:
1. Stop-and-Frisk Data (currently for NYPD and Toronto PD)
2. Salary Data (webscrape of the tech sector from Glassdoor)
3. Food Costs and Access Data (downloaded via the FDA)

(See the specific guidelines for each dataset)

### What is this respository for?
The concept behind this repsitory of data is to provide students and teachers of data science and analytics with access to a library of curated datasets, broadly gathered around the themes of equity, diversity, and inclusion. Within this library of datasets, the concept of EDI is broadly interpreted: for instance, the food costs and access data points to both potential successes and challenges with increasing access to food at an equitable price. I've made this data available to anyone interested, but please share with me anything interesting you find - I'm fascinated to see where we can take this project. Overtime I plan to see this repository grow, and to provide more example questions and analysis that can be completed within the data sets. Please contact me if you feel uncertain or have any questions.

### What can I do with this data?
Honestly, you can do whatever the heck you want with this data! But, we have been working to build a list of example questions around certain themes that can help professors to develop classes and students to practice specific skills. Why don't you check out the file containing the questions in the repository. The license for this repository does not include commercial or research use of the data without prior permission of the owner. The intention here is for educational purposes.

### How can I contribute?
Here are some ways you can contribute towards this initiative:
* Share other datasets (or ideas for datasets) you think could/should be included
* Share with example questions that could be address with the data
* Share with analyses you have run and findings you have
